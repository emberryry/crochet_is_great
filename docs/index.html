        <h1>My Progress with Crocheting</h1>
        <p>I started crocheting at the beginning of February after being told about how it could help with anxiety and adhd. From the point that I started till now, I have worked on several projects that can be seen here!</p>

        <p><a href="page_2.html">Link to my second page!</a></p>
        <p>Pictured here is the first bandana that I made! The materials I used were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blue yarn from Concept</li>
            <li>4 mm crochet hook</li>
            <li>stitch markers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also made another matching bandana for my friend, but I added a yellow border around theirs. I used a shell stitch to do that, which is 5 dc (double crochet) in one stitch.</p>
